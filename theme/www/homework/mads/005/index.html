			<h2>Basic semantic HTML</h2>
			
			<p>In this article, you will get to work with <em>h1</em>, <em>h2</em>, <em>h3</em>, <em>p</em>, strong and em tags.</p>
	
			<h3>The basic semantic text tags</h3>
			<p>The minimum set of semantic text HTML tags contains <em>h1</em>, <em>h2</em>, <em>h3</em>, <em>p</em>, <em>strong</em> and <em>em</em>. Although there are many other 
			semantic html tags, these are the most important ones to learn.</p>
			<p>Other semantic HTML tags include <em>table</em>, <em>ul</em>, <em>ol</em> and <em>dl</em>.</p>
			<p>We will look more at the other semantic tags later.</p>
	
			<h4>The h1 tag</h4>
			<p>The <em>h1 tag</em> is the primary headline of a page. There should only ever be one primary headline in a page.</p>
			<h4>The h2 tag</h4>
	
			<p>The <em>h2 tag</em> is for secondary headlines in your page. The secondary headlines are used for each subsection 
			of the primary content.</p>
			<p>There will often be multiple secondary headlines in your pages.</p>
	
			<h4>The h3 tag</h4>
			<p>The <em>h3 tag</em> is for tertiary headlines in your page. The tertiary headlines are used for each subsection 
			of the current secondary section.</p>
			<p>There will often be multiple tertiary headlines in your pages.</p>
	
			<h4>The p tag</h4>
			<p>The <em>p tag</em> is used for a paragraph of text. Each headline will typically be followed by one or more 
			paragraphs, relating directly to the previous headline.</p>
			<p>There will often be multiple paragraphs in your pages.</p>
	
			<h4>The strong tag</h4>
			<p>The <em>strong tag</em> is used to indicate that a certain word (or several words) are more important in the context.</p>
			<p>The <em>strong tag</em> is an inline tag and can only be used inside headlines or paragraphs.</p>
	
			<h4>The em tag</h4>
			<p>The <em>em tag</em> is used to indicate that a certain word (or several words) needs emphasis in the context.</p>
			<p>The <em>em tag</em> is an inline tag and can only be used inside headlines or paragraphs.</p>
	
			<h4>Summary</h4>
			<p>Now you have a basic understanding of HTML text semantics. You have added a hierarchy to the text and made it easier
			to read and to be understood by a machine. Let's move on the some of the other semantic tags.</p>
