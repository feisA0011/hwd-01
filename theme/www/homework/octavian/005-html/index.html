				<h1 itemprop="headline">Basic semantic HTML</h1>
				
				<p itemprop="description">In this article, you will get to work with <strong>h1, h2, h3, p, strong </strong> and <strong>em</strong> tags.</p>
					
				<h2>The basic semantic text tags</h2>
					
				<p>The minimum set of semantic text HTML tags contains h1, h2, h3, p, strong and em. Although there are many other 
					semantic html tags, these are the most important ones to learn.</p>
					
				<p>Other semantic HTML tags include table, ul, ol and dl.</p>
					
				<p>We will look more at the other semantic tags later.</p>
					
				<h3>The h1 tag</h3>
					
				<p>The h1 tag is the primary headline of a page. There should only ever be one primary headline in a page.</p>
					
				<h3>The h2 tag</h3>
					
				<p>The h2 tag is for secondary headlines in your page. The secondary headlines are used for each subsection 
					of the primary content.</p>
					
				<p>There will often be multiple secondary headlines in your pages.</p>
					
				<h3>The h3 tag</h3>
					
				<p>The h3 tag is for tertiary headlines in your page. The tertiary headlines are used for each subsection 
					of the current secondary section.</p>
					
				<p>There will often be multiple tertiary headlines in your pages.</p>
					
				<h3>The p tag</h3>
					
				<p>The p tag is used for a paragraph of text. Each headline will typically be followed by one or more 
					paragraphs, relating directly to the previous headline.</p>
					
				<p>There will often be multiple paragraphs in your pages.</p>
					
				<strong>The strong tag</strong>
					
				<p>The strong tag is used to indicate that a certain word (or several words) are more important in the context.</p>
					
				<p>The strong tag is an inline tag and can only be used inside headlines or paragraphs.</p>
					
				<h3>The em tag</h3>
					
				<p>The em tag is used to indicate that a certain word (or several words) needs emphasis in the context.</p>
					
				<p>The em tag is an inline tag and can only be used inside headlines or paragraphs.</p>
					
				<h2>Summary</h2>
					
				<p><em>you have a basic understanding of HTML text semantics. You have added a hierarchy to the text and made it easier
					to read and to be understood by a machine. Let's move on the some of the other semantic tags.</em></p>

				<p>
					Copy the HTML formatted content of <em>body</em> from Exercise 4 into the index.html of Exercise 5. 
					You need this HTML as the baseline to add schema.org properties to it.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Add schema.org properties to your HTML</h3>
				<p>
					Consider your content as a <em>CreativeWork</em>. Add the relevant properties from the CreativeWork
					definition on schema.org to your HTML. Don't worry, this is a pretty simple content type.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Check your schema.org properties</h3>
				<p>
					Make sure all your schema.org properties are added correctly to your HTML and that all
					values are added correctly and wrapped in double-quotes (").
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Validate your HTML on w3c</h3>
				<p>
					Use <a href="https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input" target="_blank">https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input</a> to validate your HTML.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Test the structured data</h3>
				<p>
					Use <a href="https://search.google.com/structured-data/testing-tool" target="_blank">https://search.google.com/structured-data/testing-tool</a> to 
					test the schema.org properties you have added. Fix any errors or warnings and test again.
