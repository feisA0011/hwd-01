		<h1>Exercise 317 - JS, Manipulator framework 2</h1>
		<p>
			This exercise is about using the Manipulator framework.
		</p>
		<p>
			The purpose of this exercise is to practice using a framework to structure your 
			application of code. In this exercise we will be adding a custom initializer object
			and mapping it to a node in our HTML.
		</p>
		<p class="note">
			Use the script tag in the bottom of the exercise page to write your JavaScript.
		</p>
		<p class="note">
			The manipulator library is included in this page. You can use everything you find
			in the <a href="http://manipulator.local/docs">Manipulator library documentation</a>.
		</p>

		<h2>Tasks</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<h3>Include the scene initializer object</h3>
				<p>
					In <em>js/i-scene.js</em> you will find an empty "scene" initializer object.
					Right now it is not doing anything other than outputting a text in the
					console. It is not active yet, because it is not included in your page AND
					the initializer class "i:scene" has not been added to the HTML.
				</p>
				<p>
					Add a script tag in your <em>head</em> and include the i-scene.js file into
					your HTML page. It's looks a lot like the script include tag for i-page.js
					that already exists in the exercise page.
				</p>
				<p>
					Add an initializer classname, "i:scene" to the <em>div.scene</em> element
					and check that the output from the scene initializer object occurs in the 
					console when you refresh your page.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Initialize the form</h3>
				<p>
					In the scene initializer, query the form element and initialize the form
					using <em>Util.Form.init()</em>, the form initializer from Manipulator. This enables 
					JavaScript input validation and event callbacks from form interaction.
				</p>
				<p>
					Create a callback method, called "submitted", on the form element. This method will be
					called when the submit button is pressed. You will add functionality later.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Show the scene</h3>
				<p>
					The scene should be shown only when the content is ready, and we want to fade up the
					content elements one by one. First the headline, then the paragraphs, then the form
					elements and finally the buttons. But to do that we have to set their individual 
					opacity to 0, before we show the scene (which currently has opacity: 0 and is hiding
					the scene as a whole).
				</p>
				<p>
					Query the elements that we want to fade up and set their opacity to 0. Consider if
					there is a way to get all of them in one query â€“ or at least add them to an array
					that you can iterate through.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now that the individual elements are hidden, you can set the opacity of the 
					scene to 1.
				</p>
				<p>
					Make a loop and add a transition and opacity:1 to each of the elements, while
					increasing the transition delay value for each iteration. That way they will apear
					one after the other.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Hide the scene</h3>
				<p>
					In the <em>submitted</em> method you created on the form element earlier, you
					make a loop and fade each of the elements back to opacity:0, again increasing the
					delay for each iteration. After the final element has faded out, you make an alert
					announcing that the assignment is complete.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now the scene elements will fade out one by one, when the form is submitted, which will
					only happen when there are no errors in the form.
				</p>
			</li>
