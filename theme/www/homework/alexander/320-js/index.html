		<h1>Exercise 320 - JS, Marc Fachini intro</h1>
		<p>
			This exercise is about being creative.
		</p>
		<p>
			The purpose of this exercise is to practice creative coding.
		</p>
		<p>
			I am currently working on a minimalistic project for Marc Fachini, a website presenting
			his new album, Himmelmekanik. I could use some help with the page intro.
		</p>
		<p>
			The project consists of 5 scenes, which will each, in turn, fill out the entire browser window.
		</p>
		<p>
			First an intro (which I would like you to help me out with).
			After that comes an audio player, which plays side A of the LP. If you move the mouse
			while listening, the music stops, possibly replaced by the sound of a pickup moving sideways.
			The point is, focus on the music – take your time.
			After that, a short text, while we turn the record.
			And then a second audio player with side B and finally a thanks for listening.
		</p>
		<p>
			So, in the exercise page you find the text for the intro on the site. We need this text to
			apear in a slow and relaxed manner – possibly with a touch of "handmade" feel to it – and then
			a bunch of megacool on top. You can use the whole window and it's ok to have to scroll down in
			this first scene. The background must be white.
		</p>
		<p>
			It ok to get inspiration from others, but try to visualize how it could be and then try build it.
			The process of transforming and idea into actual code is an interesting one.
