		<h1>Exercise 302 - JS, Query and manipulate</h1>
		<p>
			This exercise is about using native JS for querying and manipulation the HTML.
		</p>

		<p>
			The purpose of this exercise is to practice basic DOM manipulation, by querying elements and moving them into
			correct order.
		</p>
		<p class="note">

		<h2>Tasks</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<h3>Make 5 variables with references to the 5 div's (a1-a5)</h3>
				<p>
					Make 5 variables with "easy to understand" variable names. Query each of the 5 div's and store the 
					reference in each of the 5 variables.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Move the 5 element into correct order</h3>
				<p>
					Use the basic DOM manipulation methods to move the 5 elements into correct order in the top of 
					the div#content â€“ Ordered by the texts: A1, A2, A3, A4 and A5. The elements with "I'm clueless", 
					should remain in their current position. It is ok to leave empty <em>li</em>'s behind.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Check that the newly generated HTML is valid</h3>
				<p>
					Use the inspector to verify that your manipulation resulted in valid HTML.
