		<h1>Exercise 308 - JS, Browser events</h1>
		<p>
			This exercise is about using native Browser events.
		</p>

		<p>
			The purpose of this exercise is to practice basic JS, by capturing and dealing with events
			from by the browser. You will be using the resize, scroll and DOMContentLoaded events in this
			exercise.
		</p>
		<p class="note">
			Use the script tag in the bottom of the exercise page to write your JavaScript.
		</p>

		<h2>Tasks</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<h3>Add a <em>DOMContentLoaded</em> event listener to the Window object</h3>
				<p>
					Add a <em>DOMContentLoaded</em> event listener to the Window object.
					Make a function called <em>contentLoaded</em> and use this as the callback function 
					for the event listener.
				</p>
				<p>
					In <em>contentLoaded</em>, create a new div with the text "Content loaded", and 
					append it to <em>#content</em>, to show that the content has loaded.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Add a <em>resize</em> and <em>scroll</em> event listener.</h3>
				<p>
					When the content has loaded - and only after this event has occurred - then add event 
					listeners for resize and scroll events.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Deal with <em>resize</em> events</h3>
				<p>
					Find a way to identify the new width and height of the browser. Create <strong>one</strong> new
					div in <em>#content</em> and write the current size of the window into this div. 
					You should not create a new div for each event, but rather re-use the same div for all 
					resize events, so that it always contains the current size of the window. 
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Deal with <em>scroll</em> events</h3>
				<p>
					Find a way to identify the current scroll position of the browser. Create <strong>one</strong> new
					div in <em>#content</em> and write the current scroll position into this div. 
					You should not create a new div for each event, but rather re-use the same div for all 
					scroll events, so that it always contains the current scroll position. 
				</p>
			</li>
