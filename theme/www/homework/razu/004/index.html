				<h1>Basic semantic HTML</h1>

					<p>
						In this article, you will get to work with <strong>h1</strong>, <strong>h2</strong>, <strong>h3</strong>, <strong>p</strong>, <strong>strong</strong> and <strong>em</strong> tags.
					</p>

					<h2>The basic semantic text tags</h2>

						<p>
							The minimum set of semantic text HTML tags contains <strong>h1</strong>, <strong>h2</strong>, <strong>h3</strong>, <strong>p</strong>, <strong>strong</strong> and <strong>em</strong>. Although there are many other 
							html tags, these are the most important ones to learn.
						</p>

						<p>
							Other semantic HTML tags include <em>table</em>, <em>ul</em>, <em>ol</em> and <em>dl</em>.

							We will look more at the other semantic tags later.
						</p>

						<h3>The h1 tag</h3>

							<p>
								The <strong>h1</strong> tag is the primary headline of a page. There should only ever be one primary headline in a page.
							</p>

						<h3>The h2 tag</h3>

							<p>
								The <strong>h2</strong> tag is for secondary headlines in your page. The secondary headlines are used for each subsection 
								of the primary content.
								There will often be multiple secondary headlines in your pages.
							</p>

						<h3>The h3 tag</h3>

							<p> 
								The <strong>h3</strong> tag is for tertiary headlines in your page. The tertiary headlines are used for each subsection 
								of the current secondary section.
								There will often be multiple tertiary headlines in your pages
							</p>

						<h3>The p tag</h3>

							<p>
								The <strong>p</strong> tag is used for a paragraph of text. Each headline will typically be followed by one or more 
								paragraphs, relating directly to the previous headline.
								There will often be multiple paragraphs in your pages
							</p>

						<h3> The strong tag</h3>

							<p>
								The <strong>strong</strong> tag is used to indicate that a certain word (or several words) are more important in the context.

								strong tag is an inline tag and can only be used inside headlines or paragraphs.
							</p>

						<h3>The em tag</h3>

							<p>
								The <strong>em</strong> tag is used to indicate that a certain word (or several words) needs emphasis in the context.

								The em tag is an inline tag and can only be used inside headlines or paragraphs.
							</p>

					<h2><em>Summary</em></h2>

						<p>
							<em>
								Now you have a basic understanding of HTML text semantics. You have added a hierarchy to the text and made it easier
								to read and to be understood by a machine. Let's move on the some of the other semantic tags.
