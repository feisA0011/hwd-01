Week 1

*Assignment 1:*
Find an example of open source software already on your computer
Find an example of permissive free software already on your computer
Find an example of GPL software on your computer

*Assignment 2 - team-office:*
As a group, you'll help each other to make sure every team member has the required OS on their computer. Mac OS (any version), Linux (any version) or Windows 10. If for some reason this is not possible, the team should propose an alternative solution.

*Assignment 3 - home office:*
Research and make a proposal for which license we should use for the KBHFF project. Prepare to present your proposal for the group on Tuesdays. After presenting your proposals, we will discuss pros and cons and finally decide which license we will use for the onwards development.

*A small recap of the assignments of week 1:*
Looking for different kinds of open source software on your computers showed that most of the open source software had been installed by the user. However, it was interesting to find that notepad.exe is in fact open source. There are more examples deeper in the operating systems, but we also see that the adoption of open source projects are done when it is in the interest of the software producer, and less as an act of the idealism. We won’t find any GPL licensed software embedded in the operation system, as this would then require the whole operating system to be GPL’d. The exercise also showed that it can sometimes be very hard to identify the license of an application. The “Find an example of open source software already on your computer” was a bit of a trick question to underline the fluffiness of the term. We talked a bit about how the WebKit project, an Apple sponsored open source project, lead to the biggest positive change in the browser market … ever … and that you’ve all reaped the benefits from this project. We will expand more on that when we get to week 4.
It might be worth mentioning the AdBlock extension that Elisabeth found as an example of open source software. In particular when it comes to browser extensions, which essentially has the power to monitor every move you make on the internet and sell your private data, the open source aspect is important, as that is the only way to scrutinise the source code and ensure your privacy.



Summary:
The Open Source GPLv3 license has been chosen for the Kbhff-IT project for the following reasons:

The GPLv3 license is in alignment with the core values of Kbhff, e.g. transparency, support a working community, sharing and collaborating.
Kbhff makes a clear statement using this license. Other Open source licenses, such as the MIT license is easier to use for others, but doesn’t enforce transparency and sharing source code and thereby giving back to the community.
Kbhff cannot control what others use the code developed in Kbhff-IT for, but with the GPLv3 license ensure modifications to the code is shared and freely available for others to use under the same license.
The GPLv3 limits the Kbhff-IT project (and future modifications made by Kbhff or others) to use “closed” source code as part of the project. The project can for example not use a sms plugin unless it is licensed under MIT, GPLv3 or other Open Source license variants.
