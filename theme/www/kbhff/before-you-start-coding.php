		<h1>Before you start coding</h1>
		<p>
			When lot's of people contribute to the same project, things tend to get messy. 
			We have different ways of writing code, different levels of understanding and so on.
			Because of this we have made some basic conventions that puts us on the same page and serves as best practices for coding.
			Before you start contributing to the KBHff-project be sure to read below to understand the conventions we follow in this project.
			If you're a newbie or intermediate in HTML and CSS you should read it extra carefully, 
			since a lot of the stuff is also about how to be great at writing code.
