			<h2>Installing the webstack</h2>
			<p>
				So what is a webstack? Well it's a collection of software you'll need to have before you can start building anything on the web.
				It's the foundation, we build on.
			</p>
			<p>The most basic forms of webstack are usually comprised of an Operating systen, a Http-server, an Application-server and a Database server.</p>
			<p>
				An example could be the <em>LAMP</em> stack which runs on a Linux operating system and uses the Apache Http-server,
				MariaDB/MySQL database and PHP application server.
			</p>
			<p>Since the project is based on the parentNode webstack, you'll first need to install it.</p>

			<h2>Working with git</h2>
			<p>Git is a <em>version control system</em>, it essentially allows multiple people to work on the same project.</p>
			<p>As Git is just a program we will need a host where we can upload our projects, or contribute to existing ones.</p>
			<p>
				The hosting platform we will use is <strong>GitHub</strong>, since it's the most popular host around and is completely free!
				This is also where kbhff is hosted.
			</p>
			<p><a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/">Here's how to get started with GitHub</a></p>
			<p>Working with GitHub through the browser isn't always what you want so you should download a GitHub client</p>
			<p>We recommend GitHub desktop starting out as it's free and the simplest way to use Git.</p>
			<p>
				Github Desktop is a bit different from the website but there's alot of upsides to using a client, such as easily being able to update and upload your files,
				there are other clients with more features at the expense of usability.
