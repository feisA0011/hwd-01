			<h1>Before you start coding</h1>
			<p>
				When lots of people contribute to the same project, things tend to get messy.
				We have different ways of writing code, different levels of understanding and so on.
				Because of this, we have made some basic conventions that put us on the same page
				and serve as best practice for coding.
			</p>
			<p>
				Before you start contributing to the KBHFF-project be sure to read below to
				understand the conventions we follow in this project. If you're a newbie or
				intermediate in HTML and CSS you should read it extra carefully, since a lot of
				the stuff is also about how to be great at writing code.

			<h2>Seperation of content and design</h2>
			<p>
				It's important to use the different programming languages for what they are best for.
			</p>
			<p>
				HTML is a markup language. It is used to tell the system what the content is (mark up the content).
				For instance a piece of text could be marked as a header, a subheader or a paragraph, or as a link.
			</p>
			<p>
				When you write HTML try to think about it as meant for a screen reader
				(a program that reads the webpage out loud to people with visual impairments).
				The visually impaired person cannot see the structure of the page or the
				color that seperates headlines from paragraphs, so to her/him it's critical
				that the content is marked up correctly, well structured and easy to remember,
				even without the visual clues.
			</p>
			<p>
				Luckily this doesn't only helps visually impaired people use our website,
				it also helps other programmers make sense of our code since the code itself becomes easier to read.
			</p>
				CSS on the other hand is used to create a good looking and user friendly visual representation
				of the content. We can use CSS to place our content on the screen, to add colors or styles and
				even to add animations. Where HTML is all about content. CSS is all about visual design.
			</p>
			<p>
				The distinction between content and visual design is very important because it serves as the
				base logic behind the organization and writing of our code, making it more clear and less
				prone to errors.

			<h2>Dos and don'ts in our HTML</h2>
			<p>
				Introduction to this section...
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<h3>Don't use line breaks (br) as substitute for paragrahps</h3>
					<p>
						the br-tag is a way to force a new line. Its usually considered bad practice
						to use this inside a block of text. Instead divide the text into to paragraphs.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Never use two br-tags after each other</h3>
					<p>
						Sometimes you see programmers using to br-tags to create som emtpy lines between elements,
						this is consideres bad practice and should be avoided since it will lead to problems further on.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Write code for the screen reader</h3>
					<p>
						People with impaired vision, visiting websites can be hard....
						<a href="">read more about alt attributes.</a>
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Use of inline and block elements</h3>
					<p>
						Take care to use inline-level elements and block-level elements as they are meant to be used.
						Never put block-level elements inside of inline-level-elements.
					</p>
					<p>
						Read more about block and inline elements:
