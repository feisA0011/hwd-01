		<h1>Before you start coding</h1>
		<p>
			When lot's of people contribute to the same project, things tend to get messy. 
			We have different ways of writing code, different levels of understanding and so on.
			Because of this we have made some basic conventions that puts us on the same page and serves as best practices for coding.
			Before you start contributing to the KBHff-project be sure to read below to understand the conventions we follow in this project.
			If you're a newbie or intermediate in HTML and CSS you should read it extra carefully, 
			since a lot of the stuff is also about how to be great at writing code.

		<h2>Seperation of content and design</h2>
		<p>
			It's important to use the different programming languages, for what they are best for.
		</p>
		<p>
			HTML is a markup language. It is used to tell the system what the content is (mark up the content). 
			For instance a piece of tekst could be marked as a header, a subheader or a paragrahp, or as a link.
		</p>
		<p>
			When you write HTML try to think about it as meant for a screen reader 
			(a program that reads the webpage out loud to people with impaire sight)
			The visually impaired person cannot see the structure of the page or the color 
			that seperates headlines from paragraphs, so to her/him it's critical that the content
			is, marked up correctly, well structured and easy to remember even without the visual clues.
		</p>
		<p>
			Luckily this doesn't only helps visually imparie people use our website, 
			it also helps onther coders make sense of our code since the code becomes easier to read.
		</p>
		<h3>CSS</h3>
		<p>
			CSS on the other hand is used to create a good looking and user friendly visual representation of the content. 
			We can use CSS to place our content on the screen, to add colors or styles and even to add animations.
			Where HTML is all about content. CSS is all about visual design.
		</p>
		<p>
			The distinction between content and visual design is very important because it serves as a basic logic behind the 
			organization and writing of our code, making it more clear and less prone to errors.
