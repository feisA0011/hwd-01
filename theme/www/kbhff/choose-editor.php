<h1>Choose editor</h1>
<h2>You can find a bunch of text editors out there today, and the task of finding one that fits your needs may seem like an overwhelming task.</h2>
<p>As you try to find your way in the jungle of text editors, you have to consider their advantages and disadvantages when choosing the right one. Do you want to pay money for the editor? Do you have any idealistic and political concerns when choosing the right technology? Does it have to be userfriendly with an easy userinterface? Does customization mean a lot to you? And what about performance? I would like to give a summary with focus on these questions of the 4 most popular text editors below.

<h3>Atom</h3>
<p>Atom is free and open source, so if you care about open source and free softwares, this is the perfect choice. It is developed by the <strong>Github community</strong>, with the members contributing to the <strong>many add-on packages</strong> that are all developed by the community. This means that you can extend Atom's capabilities and features with a high degree of freedom and choices <strong>(6.452 packages and themes)</strong>. It furthermore has a very userfriendly design, which is completely customizable. This means that you can make it look just the way you like it and that it is <strong>very easy to pick up for a beginner</strong>. An issue which is important to consider is the performance. Sometimes <strong>Atom feels slow</strong>, it consumes a lot of memory and tend to crash if you load large files. However it has gotten a lot better since it was first released, which is only 3 years ago. In fact, Atom is actually a pretty <strong>new player in the field</strong>, only beeing a couple of years old, however it has already gained huge popularity among the many developeres out there. You should choose Atom if you care about open source and you want an editor that is customizable and easy to pick up on for beginners.</p>

<h3>Visual Studio Code</h3>
<p>Visual Studio Code is the attempt by Microsoft to create a <strong>free and lightweight, but powerfull and flexible text teditor</strong>. Microsoft already sits on the heavy Visual Studio editions, which is 3 GB+ in size and therefore huge and massive and not ideal for development purposes. This new edition try to do the same job but is just much smaller in size. It is also pretty <strong>new to the market (from 2015)</strong> and comes with a <strong>lot of avaliable extensions.</strong> The userinterface is customizable, which means that you can <strong>personalize your editor with themes</strong> just as you prefer. It is said to be easy for beginners to pick up on, however I feel that Atom was much more convenient. Some of the featues includes the support of <strong>30+ programming languages and auto complete.</strong> The best thing about Visual Studio Code is definentely the <strong>small size and thus the quick installation and usage.</strong> So if you don't care about big capitalistic superpowers keeping and selling your data, you should definentely go for this text editor, since it is fast and flexible!</p>
