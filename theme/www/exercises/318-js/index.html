		<h1>Exercise 318 - JS, Library development</h1>
		<p>
			This exercise is about helping out on open source projects.
		</p>
		<p>
			The purpose of this exercise is to explore forking and pull-requests and how
			to approach making contributions to open source projects.
		</p>

		<h2>Tasks</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<h3>Find something that needs to be done</h3>
				<p>
					Go to the parentNode Trello board and find the Manipulator list.
				</p>
				<p>
					Find a task that you would like to do. Ask if you have any questions.
				</p>
				<p>
					Code updates require you to familiarize yourself with the code block
					you are about the change. Abide by the syntax defined by the project â€“
					sometimes in specific code conduct documentation other times by just 
					following the syntax of the existing code. The manipulator
					source files are found in: manipulator/src
				</p>
				<p>
					Documentation updates require reading the code and comparing the code with
					what is written about it. The documentation files are found in:
					manipulator_parentnode_dk/src/templates/docs.
				</p>
				<p>
					Tests updates require both reading the code and figuring out different ways it
					could be used. Test files are found in:
					manipulator_parentnode_dk/src/templates/tests and 
					manipulator_parentnode_dk/src/www/js/tests.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Do it</h3>
				<p>
					Add yourself to a card if you want to work on it. Change the label to indicate
					the current status of the project and write a comment when you start the work.
				</p>
				<p>
					When you are done, you make a pull request to let me know that you have corrections
					ready to be merged into the main repository.
				</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
