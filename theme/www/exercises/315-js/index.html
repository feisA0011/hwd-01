			<h2>Tasks</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<h3>Build a DOM structure</h3>
					<p>
						Add a structure containing a <em>div</em> with the classname <em>scene</em>. 
						Add it to <em>div#content</em>. Make the scene as high as the browser window.
					</p>
					<p>Add three div's to the scene.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Request quotes</h3>
					<p>
						Use <em>u.request</em> to make a request to https://random-quote-generator.herokuapp.com/api/quotes/random to get a quote for
						each of the three div's. You are supposed to make three requests so you get a different quote for each div.
						The Quote API returns a JSON object â€“ you should use the <em>quote</em> value, to insert into your div.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Add CSS</h3>
					<p>
						Use <em>u.ass</em> to make the 3 div's 100px wide and high. You may distribute them nicely if you wish.
					</p>
					<p>
						Add three different colors and/or background animations to the three divs. 
						Background animations can ba created by adding additional html as needed.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Add event listeners</h3>
					<p>
						Add a click listener to each of the three div's. Prepare them to make an event callback to the same 
						function, which will make them jump.
					</p>
					<p>
						In the event callback, make the clicked element jump to the bottom of the screen by applying a CSS 
						translate property. Wait for one second, then let it jump back up. <em>Use u.a.transition</em> 
						to apply transition timing to the movement. Use the third parameter to add a custom callback method
						where you apply the "jump back" animation. 
					</p>
				</li>
