		<h1>Exercise 405 - Janitor and Detector</h1>
		<p>
			This exercise is about developing your first Janitor based PHP project
		</p>
		<p>
			The purpose of this exercise is to work with your personal Janitor project to gain experience
			with Janitor and Detector segments.
		</p>

		<h2>Tasks</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<h3>Understand the Detector segments</h3>
				<p>
					Janitor natively supports Detector segments. While Janitor can also be used entirely without segments
					it is recommended to use the segments to provide optimized UI's for each segment, rather than 
					<em>one size fits all</em>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Janitor will automatically detect the segment of the visiting browser, by making a request
					to the Detector API, when the <em>$page->segment</em>
					method is called. As default this happens in the <em>templates/www.header.php</em> template, where
					the segment of the current user's browser is used to include the correct JavaScript and CSS. The detection 
					process only happens once per site visit and the detected segment is stored in the user session for
					the duration of the visit.
				</p>
				<p>
					In addition Janitor accepts a <em>dev=1</em> GET parameter on any page, which will force the site 
					to load the development code, rather than the generated production code. This parameter simply
					indicates whether to include the system generated JavaScript and CSS bundles or the individual
					source files. Use <em>dev=1</em> when developing for better debugging options.
				</p>
				<p>
					You will learn more about how to structure your JavaScript and CSS in the following exercises.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Defining the segment support</h3>
				<p>
					The exact segment support can be individualized for each Janitor project. In 
					<em>theme/config/segments.php</em> you will find the settings for your current project
					in an associative Array. You will find that the keys represent the available segments,
					and the values specify which segment will be returned, when a browser from any of the
					segments visits your page.
