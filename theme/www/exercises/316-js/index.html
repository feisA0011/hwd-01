		<h1>Exercise 316 - JS, Manipulator framework 1</h1>
		<p>
			This exercise is about using the Manipulator framework.
		</p>
		<p>
			The purpose of this exercise is to practice using a framework to structure your application of code.
		</p>
		<p class="note">
			Use the script tag in the bottom of the exercise page to write your JavaScript.
		</p>
		<p class="note">
			The manipulator library is included in this page. You can use everything you find
			in the <a href="http://manipulator.local/docs">Manipulator library documentation</a>.
		</p>

		<h2>Tasks</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<h3>Investigate the code</h3>
				<p>
					In <em>index.html</em> you will find a small, regular snippet of HTML. Note that the <em>div.scene</em> has an 
					<em>opacity:0</em> setting in the CSS in the top of the page, so it will be invisible from the beginning.
				</p>
				<p>
					In <em>js/i-page.js</em> you will find a simple page controller. It's <em>init</em> method will 
					automatically be called when the DOMContentReady event occurs. It will output an "init page" text in the console.
					This happens because of the DOMReady event listener/handler in the bottom of the i-page.js file
					 â€“ AND the page initializer classname (i:page) on the <em>div#page</em> in index.html. If you remove the 
					 initializer classname on the <em>div#page</em>, then the <em>init</em> method will not be called. 
					 Try to remove the initializer classname and observe the result. 
					 Remember to put it back before you continue.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the page initializer, three new methods are created for the page object (div#page), 
					<em>resized</em>, <em>scrolled</em> and <em>ready</em>. The <em>ready</em> method will be called instantly and 
					the <em>resized</em> method will be invoked on page resize and <em>scrolled</em> on page scroll, 
					due to the two event listeners applied in the <em>ready</em> method.
				</p>
				<p>
					Finally the ready method defines a reference to the current scene, which can be used later in your code.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Make the page resize handler</h3>
				<p>
					The scene should always be as high as the browser. Set the scene height in page.resized.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Show the page</h3>
				<p>
					The scene should be shown only when the page is ready. Add a transition and change the opacity to 1
					to make the page fade up, when it is ready.
				</p>
			</li>
