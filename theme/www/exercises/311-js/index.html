			<h1>Exercise 311 - JS, Event fun</h1>
			<p>
				This exercise is about using events to create effects.
			</p>

			<p>
				The purpose of this exercise is to practice basic JS, by capturing and dealing with events
				and using them to do something completely different, than the user would probably expect.
			</p>
			<p class="note">
				Use the script tag in the bottom of the exercise page to write your JavaScript.
			</p>

			<h2>Tasks</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<h3>Add a <em>wheel</em> event listener to the Window object</h3>
					<p>
						This event will occur when the user uses the scroll wheel on their mouse or a
						trackpad with scrolling capabilities on their computer.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Detect scroll direction</h3>
					<p>
						The page won't actually scroll, but the event will still occur with a delta setting,
						which tells you the direction of the scroll.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Deal with the <em>delta</em> value</h3>
					<p>
						Use the delta value to increase or decrease the font size of the text.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
