			Parentnode Guide - Enable Site
		</h1>
		<p>
			This guide helps you enable a web project on your own computer. It expects that you have already set up the web stack on your computer. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Let's say you just cloned or downloaded a parentNode project to you local computer, and now you want to see it in your browser. That is what Enabling a site is all about. It means, that you'll make the Apache HTTP server aware of you local code, so it can serve it through your browser on a specific domain, typically only accessible on your local computer.
		</p>
		<p>
			Practically speaking enabling a site involves two steps. Adding the local domain to your hosts-file and including the project Apache configuration to your Apache HTTP server. I'll explain more about that below. Although enabling a site expects you to already have the project source code on your computer, I have added that step to this guide for your convenience.
			A parentNode project always comes with its own individual Apache configuration and a local test domain. It is designed this way to make collaboration between users across platforms easier, by ensuring an identical environment and configuration.
